        <h3 class="oofooCardTitle">Terms of Service</h3>
		<div class="oofooCardBody">
            <p>Oofoos and related species are maintained and owned by <a href="https://pepper-wood.deviantart.com/">Pepper-Wood</a>. The rules posted here can be updated by the admins periodically. By owning a character part of the <a href="https://oofoos.deviantart.com/">oofoos</a> world, you are agreeing to the rules below.</p>
            <h2>Ownership Rights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Oofoos are multi-dimensional creatures. While in the Foo World, feel free to create a backstory and personality for your oofoo so long as it fits. But they also can travel to other worlds, in the event you want to expand further.</li>
                <li>Artists of Oofoo designs retain the rights to their original artwork, meaning they are free to use it for self-promotional purposes (portfolios, commission examples, etc.).</li>
                <li>We do not taking scamming and related occurrences lightly. Any person who misuses Oofoo characters - through scamming, chargebacks, etc. - the group will cut off ownership and revoke the design.</li>
                <li>"Oofoo Recycling Program": Under the circumstances that the owner of an Oofoo deactivates their account and 1 full month passes without the group being notified of a change in ownership, the Oofoo can be reclaimed and redistributed through a non-payment based method (i.e. as a Raffle or DTA/XTA prize).</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Resale and Trade</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no appraisal system in place for assigning selling prices. Feel free to value your Oofoo as you see fit.</li>
                <li>Please verify the validity of character ownership using the <a href="https://oofoodatabase.deviantart.com/">OofooDatabase</a></li>
                <li>Please notify the <a href="https://oofoodatabase.deviantart.com/">OofooDatabase</a> of any change in ownership by commenting on the image of the character. We will require both parties to confirm in the comments before changing the description (i.e. Party A comments "B traded this to me" and Party B replies "Confirming").</li>
                <li>Please notify the group of any circumstances of scamming or lack of communication between the trade parties such that one party has not received their rewards.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Creation Regulations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Oofoo redesigns are prohibited without use of ARPG items. There will hopefully be enough flexibility from items such that members don't feel "restricted" by the original design.</li>
                <li>All redesigns will be submitted to <a href="https://oofoodatabase.deviantart.com/">OofooDatabase</a> to update the character's image.</li>
                <li>Designs mostly based on trademarked characters are prohibited, i.e. an Oofoo styled to look like Pikachu is prohibited, but a yellow Oofoo with red cheek circles is allowed.</li>
                <li>Changing clothing and accessories is allowed, with the exception of magically-bound items</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Submission Regulations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Please submit to the appropriate folders</li>
                <li>Traced content is strictly prohibited. All artwork, including YCHs, has to be your own work and/or using a base with approval for use.</li>
                <li>NSFW content, i.e. no gore, candygore, excessive violence, nudity, or pornographic themes, are all strictly prohibited</li>
                <li>Commission journals must be specific to Oofoos, i.e. no generalized "chibi commissions" advertisements. "Trading" and "Looking For" jourals are prohibited in the group but encouraged to be posted at the <a href="http://fav.me/dc9w84z">Trade Center</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Policies may be added as I get more familiar with the world. The aim of these rules is to provide a safe environment within Oofoos (with consequences for bad behavior to discourage it).</li>
            </ul>
